VBA Challenge

Overview of the Project
   
   For the Module 2 Challenge, we had to take the workbook that we completed for Steve and refactor the original code to make it run more efficiently so that 
it can handle a larger amount of data at one time.  The original code was used to run an analysis for a few select stocks in the Stock Market to see which 
stocks would be the best choice for Steveâ€™s parents to invest in. 


Results
   
   
   The 2017 stock market performed a lot better than the 2018 stocks which was made clear after refactoring the original code because the execution time 
for the edited code was reduced greatly. Below is my code that we were asked to refactor, the runtimes of the 2017 and 2018 VBA Macros and their performance 
data: 
   
  
  
  
  '1) Format the output sheet on All Stocks Analysis worksheet
    
    
    'Create a header row
  Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    Range("A1").Value = "All Stocks (2018)"
    Cells(3, 1).Value = "Ticker"
    Cells(3, 2).Value = "Total Daily Volume"
    Cells(3, 3).Value = "Return"
      '2) Initialize array of all tickers
    Dim tickers(12) As String
    tickers(0) = "AY"
    tickers(1) = "CSIQ"
    tickers(2) = "DQ"
    tickers(3) = "ENPH"
    tickers(4) = "FSLR"
    tickers(5) = "HASI"
    tickers(6) = "JKS"
    tickers(7) = "RUN"
    tickers(8) = "SEDG"
    tickers(9) = "SPWR"
    tickers(10) = "TERP"
    tickers(11) = "VSLR"
       '3a) Initialize variables for starting price and ending price
    Dim startingPrice As Single
    Dim endingPrice As Single
        '3b) Activate data worksheet
    Worksheets("2018").Activate
           '3c) Get the number of rows to loop over
    RowCount = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
      '4) Loop through tickers
    For i = 0 To 11
        ticker = tickers(i)
        totalVolume = 0
 '5) loop through rows in the data
        Worksheets(yearValue).Activate
             For j = 2 To RowCount
        '5a) Get total volume for current ticker
       If Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
       	  totalVolume = totalVolume + Cells(j, 8).Value
    End If
     '5b) get starting price for current ticker
     If Cells(j - 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
     	   startingPrice = Cells(j, 6).Value
     End If
     '5c) get ending price for current ticker
    If Cells(j + 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
    	  endingPrice = Cells(j, 6).Value
     End If
   Next i
     '6) Output data for current ticker
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    Cells(4 + i, 1).Value = ticker
    Cells(4 + i, 2).Value = totalVolume
    Cells(4 + i, 3).Value = endingPrice / startingPrice - 1
    Next i

Summary

Advantages of Refactoring Code
   The main advantage that I saw for refactoring code was that the end product showed up faster because the code script, itself was more 
 straightforward and concise. What I liked about the refactored code was that it looked cleaner and easier to read at the end, which would help 
 out anyone who is currently working with the code or looking at the code sometime in the future.
    
   As you can see from my screenshots above, the macro runtime is fast, however with the original code before the refactoring, it most definitely did not 
run that efficiently. The only issue that I could think of when refactoring the original code was that it was time-consuming.
